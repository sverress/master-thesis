	abstract = {The Orienteering Problem ({OP}) has received a lot of attention in the past few decades. The {OP} is a routing problem in which the goal is to determine a subset of nodes to visit, and in which order, so that the total collected score is maximized and a given time budget is not exceeded. A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team {OP}, the (Team) {OP} with Time Windows and the Time Dependent {OP}. Recently, a number of new variants of the {OP} was introduced, such as the Stochastic {OP}, the Generalized {OP}, the Arc {OP}, the Multi-agent {OP}, the Clustered {OP} and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the {OP}, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the {OP} has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the {OP}, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed. Finally, we also present some promising topics for future research.},

The study is based on trip records of all the shared e-scooter operators in Austin and includes trip start and end locations. We use both analysis of trip patterns and spatial regression techniques to examine how the built environment, land use, and demographics affect e-scooter trip generation. Our findings show that people use e-scooters almost exclusively in central Austin. Commuting does not seem to be the main trip purpose, and usage of e-scooters is associated with areas with high employment rates, and in areas with bicycle infrastructure. People use e-scooter sharing regardless of the affluence of the neighborhood, although less affluent areas with high usage rates have large student populations, suggesting that students use this mode of travel. Implications for planners suggest that better bicycle infrastructure will facilitate e-scooter usage, college towns are a ready market for e-scooter sharing services, and e-scooters may be a substitute for some short non-work trips, reducing car usage, and benefiting the environment.},

In our paper, we describe the development of such a system in the context of the new free-floating e-bike-sharing system ({BSS}) in Zurich, Switzerland. This {BSS} is based on the idea that users of the {BSS} co-create value by adapting their usage behavior such that the overall service level is maximized. This creates value for other users and reduces the provider’s costs for redistribution, but requires some kind of incentive system for influencing the user behavior. We describe a systematic approach of designing such a system by operationalizing the concept of value and value generation for the different actors: What exactly is the value that is to be created, and how can it be measured? By which activities is value created, and what are the options for stimulating these activities? Which design options maximize value creation? We found that this required combining two different research approaches: Empirical social research was necessary to understand user needs, value perception, motivational patterns in response to incentives, and communication needs. Operational research was necessary for assessing different options for the incentive system with respect to the value creation both for provider and users. By interlinking both research activities, we were able to design an incentive system that allows reducing the number of bikes by 30\% without diminishing the service level. Users are offered a reward for dropping-off their bikes in dynamically changing reward zones whose locations are determined based on the bike distribution and the future demand pattern. These incentives lead to two distinct behavioral responses which were assessed and quantified in an extensive real-life field test during a period of 13 weeks. The impact of the measured behavioral change on service level and the required number of bikes was modeled via simulation.},

This study combines Big Data and spatial agent-based modeling to understand the interactions between stakeholders to assist the bike-sharing system design. The key design decisions considered are the locations and capacities of bicycle parking lots in the system, as well as the connected bike lanes between parking lots. The model has been applied to the case of Hong Kong for demonstration. The results show that the parking lots with higher capacities are mostly close to the metro stations, and the cycleways are disconnected even for those that have high cycling occupancy. The results indicate that for most target people to be willing to change the parking location, the minimum fare discount rate for doing so should be set to 30\%. The average trip time can be reduced by 3.8\%, and per user cost can be reduced by 2.4\% with an expected investment of 0.12 million {USD} to build new cycle tracks and connect existing cycleways.},

This calls for ingenuity to deal with coarse open data granularity. In particular, we create a flexible, data-driven demand model by using modulated Poisson processes for temporal estimation, and Kernel Density Estimation ({KDE}) for spatial estimation. We next use this demand model alongside a configurable e-scooter sharing simulator to compare performance of different electric scooter sharing design options, such as the impact of the number of scooters and the cost of managing their charging. We focus on the municipalities of Minneapolis and Louisville which provide large scale open data about e-scooter sharing rides. Our approach let researchers, municipalities and scooter sharing providers to follow a data driven approach to compare and improve the design of e-scooter sharing system in smart cities.},

	abstract = {Carsharing has been considered as an effective means to increase mobility and reduce personal vehicle usage and related carbon emissions. In this paper, we consider problems of allocating a carshare fleet to service zones under uncertain one-way and round-trip rental demand. We employ a two-stage stochastic integer programming model, in the first stage of which we allocate shared vehicle fleet and purchase parking lots or permits in reservation-based or free-floating systems. In the second stage, we generate a finite set of samples to represent demand uncertainty and construct a spatial–temporal network for each sample to model vehicle movement and the corresponding rental revenue, operating cost, and penalties from unserved demand. We minimize the expected total costs minus profit and develop branch-and-cut algorithms with mixed-integer, rounding-enhanced Benders cuts, which can significantly improve computation efficiency when implemented in parallel computing. We apply our model to a data set of Zipcar in the Boston–Cambridge, Massachusetts, area to demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches and draw insights on carshare management. Our results show that exogenously given one-way demand can increase carshare profitability under given one-way and round-trip price differences and vehicle relocation cost whereas endogenously generated one-way demand as a result of pricing and strategic customer behavior may decrease carshare profitability. Our model can also be applied in a rolling-horizon framework to deliver optimized vehicle relocation decisions and achieve significant improvement over an intuitive fleet-rebalancing policy.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0644.},

	abstract = {Shared stand-up electric scooters are now offered in many cities as an option for short-term rental, and marketed for short-distance travel. Using life cycle assessment, we quantify the total environmental impacts of this mobility option associated with global warming, acidification, eutrophication, and respiratory impacts. We find that environmental burdens associated with charging the e-scooter are small relative to materials and manufacturing burdens of the e-scooters and the impacts associated with transporting the scooters to overnight charging stations. The results of a Monte Carlo analysis show an average value of life cycle global warming impacts of 202 g {CO}2-eq/passenger-mile, driven by materials and manufacturing (50\%), followed by daily collection for charging (43\% of impact). We illustrate the potential to reduce life cycle global warming impacts through improved scooter collection and charging approaches, including the use of fuel-efficient vehicles for collection (yielding 177 g {CO}2-eq/passenger-mile), limiting scooter collection to those with a low battery state of charge (164 g {CO}2-eq/passenger-mile), and reducing the driving distance per scooter for e-scooter collection and distribution (147 g {CO}2-eq/passenger-mile). The results prove to be highly sensitive to e-scooter lifetime; ensuring that the shared e-scooters are used for two years decreases the average life cycle emissions to 141 g {CO}2-eq/passenger-mile. Under our Base Case assumptions, we find that the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with e-scooter use is higher in 65\% of our Monte Carlo simulations than the suite of modes of transportation that are displaced. This likelihood drops to 35\%–50\% under our improved and efficient e-scooter collection processes and only 4\% when we assume two-year e-scooter lifetimes. When e-scooter usage replaces average personal automobile travel, we nearly universally realize a net reduction in environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {The Multiple Tour Maximum Collection Problem ({MTMCP}) is closely related to the classical Traveling Salesman and Vehicle Routing Problems. One major difference with the {MTMCP} is that it is not possible to visit all of the nodes in the graph in the total time allocated on a given set of tours. However, with the {MTMCP}, a reward is collected from each node that is visited. The objective of the {MTMCP} is to determine which nodes to visit on m time-constrained tours for which the total reward collected is maximized. It is assumed that each tour begins and ends at a central depot and that each node can be visited no more than one time, on at most one tour. In this paper, an optimal solution procedure is presented for the {MTMCP}. This procedure is based on a set-partitioning formulation and makes efficient use of both column generation and constraint branching. Numerical results are presented which show that this optimal procedure can be used to solve problems of realistic size in a reasonable amount of time. Scope and purpose A common assumption of many vehicle routing and scheduling problems is that each customer is to be visited exactly once, on exactly one route (tour). In this paper, we consider a problem where this is not possible. We assume that the routes are constrained in such a way that all of the customers cannot be visited. For example, suppose that we have five 8hour days to visit customers, but too many customers to visit in this amount of time. In problems where it is possible to visit all customers, the typical objective is to determine the minimum amount of time (or distance) needed to make all of the visits. Conversely, if all of the customers cannot be visited, the main objective is to determine the optimal subset of customers to visit in the time allotted. In this paper we assume that there is a reward which is collected when visiting a customer, and that the problem objective is to maximize the total reward collected.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicle sharing (e.g. ebike and e-scooter) is seen as an option to reduce the external effects of traffic (e.g. pollution, land use, traffic congestion) within urban environments. However, the flexibility and spontaneity of one-way shared mobility increases the complexity of integrating electric vehicles into hire fleets compared with round-trip vehicle sharing and commercial fleets or privately-owned vehicles. The study outlined in this paper explores the technical requirements and additional workload of shared electric vehicles compared with conventional bike sharing by simulating various battery charging schemes for shared electric vehicles based on real trip data obtained from the bike sharing system Citi Bike deployed within New York City. The first two scenarios evaluated assume that all batteries are changed at midnight (scenario 1) or during each relocation trip (scenario 2). For both scenarios, the number of additionally required battery changes is calculated depending on the battery range. The third scenario assumes that electric vehicles are able to be charged at bike sharing stations. The state of charge ({SoC}) after every trip is calculated depending on the battery range and charging speeds for various numbers of stations where charging is possible. It is found that the required range of the journeys would be too large to be supported by electric vehicles if batteries are only changed during relocation trips. However, the required battery range and charging speeds are in a realistic range if all batteries are changed one time a day or when the batteries are charged at all stations.},

	abstract = {Electric scooters are becoming immensely popular across the world as a means of reliable transportation around many cities.  As these e-scooters rely on batteries, it is important to understand how many of these e-scooters have enough battery life to transport riders and when these e-scooters might require a battery replacement.  To this end, we develop the first stochastic model to capture the battery life dynamics of e-scooters of a large scooter network.  In our model, we assume that e-scooter batteries are removable and replaced by agents called swappers.  Thus, to gain some insight about the large scale dynamics of the system, we prove a mean field limit theorem and a functional central limit theorem for the fraction of e-scooters that lie in a particular interval of battery life.  Exploiting the mean field limit and the functional central limit theorems, we develop an algorithm for determining the number of swappers that are needed to guarantee levels of probabilistic performance of the system.  Finally, we show through a stochastic simulation and real data that our stochastic model captures the relevant dynamics.},

We propose a new comprehensive dynamic bike redistribution methodology that starts from the prediction of the number and position of bikes over a system operating area and ends with a relocation Decision Support System. The relocation process is activated at constant gap times in order to carry out dynamic bike redistribution, mainly aimed at achieving a high degree of user satisfaction and keeping the vehicle repositioning costs as low as possible. An application to a test case study, together with a detailed sensitivity analysis, shows the effectiveness of the suggested novel methodology for the real-time management of the free-floating bike-sharing systems.},

Two types of nodes (i.e., easily and hardly access nodes) with different penalties are defined to represent different convenience levels of getting bikes from the {FFBSS}. The objective of the repositioning is to minimize the weighted sum of the inconvenience level of getting bikes from the system and the total unmet demand and the total operational time. To solve this problem, an enhanced version of chemical reaction optimization ({CRO}) is developed. A loading and unloading quantity adjustment procedure with the consideration of the node characteristics, including the type of node and its current state (i.e., in a balanced, surplus, or deficit state) is proposed and incorporated into this version to improve its solution quality. A concept of the nearby-node set is also proposed to narrow the search space. Numerical results are presented and indicate that compared to the traditional {CRO} and {CPLEX}, the enhanced {CRO} improves solution quality and has potential to tackle the repositioning problem for larger, longer repositioning duration, and more vehicle instances. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adjustment procedure.},

	abstract = {Free-floating bike sharing ({FFBS}) is an innovative bike sharing model. {FFBS} saves on start-up cost, in comparison to station-based bike sharing ({SBBS}), by avoiding construction of expensive docking stations and kiosk machines. {FFBS} prevents bike theft and offers significant opportunities for smart management by tracking bikes in real-time with built-in {GPS}. However, like {SBBS}, the success of {FFBS} depends on the efficiency of its rebalancing operations to serve the maximal demand as possible. Bicycle rebalancing refers to the reestablishment of the number of bikes at sites to desired quantities by using a fleet of vehicles transporting the bicycles. Static rebalancing for {SBBS} is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. {FFBS} takes it a step further, with an increase in the scale of the problem. This article is the first effort in a series of studies of {FFBS} planning and management, tackling static rebalancing with single and multiple vehicles. We present a Novel Mixed Integer Linear Program for solving the Static Complete Rebalancing Problem. The proposed formulation, can not only handle single as well as multiple vehicles, but also allows for multiple visits to a node by the same vehicle. We present a hybrid nested large neighborhood search with variable neighborhood descent algorithm, which is both effective and efficient in solving static complete rebalancing problems for large-scale bike sharing programs. Computational experiments were carried out on the 1 Commodity Pickup and Delivery Traveling Salesman Problem (1-{PDTSP}) instances used previously in the literature and on three new sets of instances, two (one real-life and one general) based on Share-A-Bull Bikes ({SABB}) {FFBS} program recently launched at the Tampa campus of University of South Florida and the other based on Divvy {SBBS} in Chicago. Computational experiments on the 1-{PDTSP} instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a tabu search algorithm and is highly competitive with exact algorithms previously reported in the literature for solving static rebalancing problems in {SBSS}. Computational experiments on the {SABB} and Divvy instances, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to deal with the increase in scale of the static rebalancing problem pertaining to both {FFBS} and {SBBS}, while deriving high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of {CPU} time.},

	abstract = {Bike sharing systems have been installed in many cities around the world and are increasing in popularity. A major operational cost driver in these systems is rebalancing the bikes over time such that the appropriate number of bikes and open docks are available to users. We combine two aspects that have previously been handled separately in the literature: determining service level requirements at each bike sharing station, and designing (near-)optimal vehicle routes to rebalance the inventory. Since finding provably optimal solutions is practically intractable, we propose a new cluster-first route-second heuristic, in which a polynomial-size Clustering Problem simultaneously considers the service level feasibility and approximate routing costs. Extensive computational results on real-world data from Hubway (Boston, {MA}) and Capital Bikeshare (Washington, {DC}) are provided, which show that our heuristic outperforms a pure mixed-integer programming formulation and a constraint programming approach.},

There were more than 6000 active E-scooters in operation each month, generating over 150,000 trips and covered approximately 117,000 miles. During this period, the average travel distance and operation time of E-scooter trips were 0.77 miles and 7.55 min, respectively. We further identified two E-scooter usage hotspots in the city (Downtown Austin and the University of Texas campus). The spatial analysis showed that more trips originated from Downtown Austin than were completed, while the opposite was true for the {UT} campus. We also investigated the relationship between the number of E-scooter trips and the surrounding environments. The results show that areas with higher population density and more residents with higher education were correlated with more E-scooter trips. A shorter distance to the city center, the presence of transit stations, better street connectivity, and more compact land use were also associated with increased E scooter usage in Austin, {TX}. Surprisingly, the proportion of young residents within a neighborhood was negatively correlated with E-scooter usage.},

However, due to spatial and temporal demand variation, stations tend to run full or empty over the course of a day. In order to establish a high service level, that is, a high percentage of users being able to perform their desired trips, it is therefore necessary to redistribute bikes among stations to ensure suitable timeof-day all levels. As available resources are scarce, the tactical planning level aims to determine efficient master tours periodically executed by redistribution vehicles. We present a service network design formulation for the bike sharing redistribution problem taking into account trip-based user demand and explicitly considering service times for bike pick-up and delivery. We solve the problem using a two-stage {MILP}-based heuristic and present computational results for small real-world instances. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the master tours for multiple demand scenarios.},

	abstract = {Mobility systems featuring shared vehicles are often unable to serve all potential customers, as the distribution of demand does not coincide with the positions of vehicles at any given time. System operators often choose to reposition these shared vehicles (such as bikes, cars, or scooters) actively during the course of the day to improve service rate. They face a complex dynamic optimization problem in which many integer-valued decisions must be made, using real-time state and forecast information, and within the tight computation time constraints inherent to real-time decision-making. We first present a novel nested-flow formulation of the problem, and demonstrate that its linear relaxation is significantly tighter than one from existing literature. We then adapt a two-stage stochastic approximation scheme from the generic {SPAR} algorithm due to Powell et al., in which rebalancing plans are optimized against a value function representing the expected cost (in terms of fulfilled and unfulfilled customer demand) of the future evolution of the system. The true value function is approximated by a separable function of contributions due to the rebalancing actions carried out at each station and each time step of the planning horizon. The new algorithm requires surprisingly few iterations to yield high-quality solutions, and is suited to real-time use as it can be terminated early if required. We provide insight into this good performance by examining the mathematical properties of our new flow formulation, and perform rigorous tests on standardized benchmark networks to explore the effect of system size. We then use data from Philadelphia’s public bike sharing scheme to demonstrate that the approach also yields performance gains for real systems.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, rapid urbanization causes a wide-range of congestion and pollution in megacities worldwide, which bears an urgent need for micromobility solutions such as electric scooters (e-scooter). Many e-scooter firms use freelancers to charge the scooter where they compete to collect and charge the e-scooters at their homes. This competition leads the chargers to travel long distances to collect e-scooters. In this paper, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming ({MILP}) model for a real-world e-scooter -Chargers Allocation ({ESCA}) problem. The proposed model allocates the e-scooters to the chargers with an emphasis on minimizing the chargers' average travelled distance to collect the e-scooters. The {MILP} returns optimal solutions in most cases; however, the {ESCA} is identified as a generalized assignment problem which classifies as an {NP}-complete combinatorial optimization problem. Moreover, we modelled the charging problem as a game between two sets of disjoint players, namely e-scooters and chargers. Then we adapted the college admission algorithm ({ACA}) to solve the {ESCA} problem. For the sake of comparison, we applied the black hole optimizer ({BHO}) algorithm to solve this problem using small and medium cases. The experimental results show that the {ACA} solutions are close to the optimal solutions obtained by the {MILP}. Furthermore, the {BHO} solutions are not as good as the {ACA} solutions, but the {ACA} solution consumes more time to solve large-scale real cases. Based on the obtained results, we recommend applying the {ACA}1 to find the near-optimal solution for large-scale instances, as the {MILP} is inapplicable to find the exact solution in comparison.},

	title = {Rebalancing and Charging Straregies in Electric Bike Sharing Systems},
	abstract = {This thesis explores the utility of combining battery swaps and bike relocation efforts by means of service vehicles in an electric bike sharing system ({BSS}). In an electric {BSS}, electric bikes are available for short-term rent between stations located in a defined geo- graphical area. With time, customer trips cause potential problems in a {BSS} related to e.g. flat batteries or accumulation of bikes in some parts of the system. This prompts the need for effective charging solutions and bike relocation strategies to maintain an efficient {BSS} that displays high levels of customer satisfaction.

There are several possible approaches to maintain an efficient electric {BSS}; this thesis focuses on how a charged and balanced system may be achieved using battery swaps in combination with relocation of bikes between charging and non-charging stations. The problem is defined as the Dynamic Stochastic Bicycle Rebalancing and Charging Prob- lem ({DSBRCP}). In previous work conducted by Fosen and Haldorsen (2019) on a simpler version of the problem, we know that exact solution methods are incapable of solving this problem for fully sized systems within reasonable time. Therefore, this thesis introduces and implements a two-stage stochastic programming column generation heuristic capable of solving this problem for real-world instances. This heuristic aims to be of value as a decision making tool when organizing electric {BSSs}.

The {DSBRCP} heuristic is composed of three main steps; 1) initializing routes and patterns, 2) solving subproblems, and 3) solving a master problem. The first step is implemented heuristically, while the second and third step find optimal solutions. In the first step, a set of routes and pattern combinations are generated using a branching algorithm. For each of the initialized route and pattern combinations, a score for the combination is found by solving a subproblem in step two. Together, the first and second step construct a column that is passed to the master problem. The master problem combines these columns to find the optimal first stage decisions for each vehicle.

An overview of previously published literature related to the topic is included in this the- sis. To the author’s knowledge, the {DSBRCP} has not been studied before. However, it has significant overlaps with the more explored bicycle rebalancing problem, which solves a less complex rebalancing problem in traditional {BSSs}, where charging decisions are ex- cluded. The main distinctions between the present problem and the rebalancing problem are the introduction of depot, charging stations, and battery swap activities. Thus, our i contribution is to solve the extended rebalancing problem that also incorporates charging decisions by means of battery swaps and charging stations.

Data from the {BSS} in Oslo, operated by Urban Infrastructure Partners ({UIP}), is used to create a simulation framework reflecting a real-world test environment for the two-stage stochastic programming column generation heuristic. Using this framework, a compu- tational study is conducted to assess solution time and discover the optimal parameter configurations. From the study, we observe that the solution time is highly dependent on the required number of subproblems to solve, which is driven by the number of service vehicles, the number of subproblem scenarios, and the branching factor when initializing routes.

The simulation framework is also used to provide managerial insights and evaluate the per- formance of service vehicles guided by heuristic decisions. To evaluate this, the number of violations occurring during a day when employing the heuristic is compared to employing alternative strategies on the same day. Two alternative strategies are introduced: a strategy with no operations and a strategy inspired by {UIP}’s current operations. From the analyses, we observe that the {DSBRCP} heuristic is able to prevent 50\% more violations in a day than the {UIP}-inspired strategy when employing five service vehicles. The improvement corresponds to a 23.3\% reduction in daily violations when compared to a system with no service vehicle operations.},
